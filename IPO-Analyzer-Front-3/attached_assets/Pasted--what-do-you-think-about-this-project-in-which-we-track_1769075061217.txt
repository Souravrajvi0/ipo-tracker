
what do you think about this project in which we track ipo's and my backend would look at the factors and tell if it's a good ipo to invest money in
This is a promising idea as a product, but it should be framed as an IPO screener and risk flagging tool, not “this IPO is good/bad, invest or not”, both for accuracy and regulatory reasons.

Why the idea is interesting
Retail IPO participation is high in India, and most people don’t read DRHP/RHP or analyze fundamentals in detail.

There is a reasonably standard checklist of factors (business model, financials, valuation, promoter quality, use of funds, industry outlook, etc.) that can be programmatically scored or at least surfaced.

You can automate boring but important work: extracting key metrics from the prospectus, comparing with listed peers, and summarizing red flags in plain language.

What your backend can actually do well
Think in terms of “decision support” instead of “buy/sell calls”.

Your backend can:

Ingest IPO data

Parse DRHP/RHP to pull revenue growth, margins, EPS, ROE/ROCE, debt levels, cash flow, promoter holding, offer-for-sale vs fresh issue, etc.

Track GMP, subscription numbers (QIB/HNI/retail), and anchor investor list from public sources where available.
​

Compute factor-based scores

Business/industry: sector growth, cyclicality, regulatory risk, market size.

Financial health: consistency of revenue/profit growth, margins, leverage, cash flows.

Valuation: P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA vs listed peers; flag “overvalued”, “fair”, “undervalued-ish” bands.

Promoters/governance: promoter track record, pledge, post-IPO holding, related-party issues.

Use of proceeds: more weight to growth capex/repayment of expensive debt, less to pure OFS cash-out.

Output a simple, opinionated summary

E.g. per IPO: “Fundamentals: 7/10, Valuation: 3/10 (expensive vs peers), Governance: 8/10, Overall risk: High – suited only for aggressive investors.”

Explicit red flags like “Large OFS, limited fresh issue; promoters aggressively exiting”, “Very high P/E vs peers despite inconsistent earnings”, etc.

Big caveats you must bake in
IPOs are structurally risky for retail; pricing is often aggressive and sentiment-driven, so even a strong “score” does not guarantee listing gains or long-term returns.

Grey market premium and oversubscription are sentiment indicators, not guarantees, and can mislead users if over-weighted.

From a legal/regulatory angle, anything that looks like “personalized investment advice” can be a problem unless you’re a registered advisor; product language must be “educational, research, screening” with disclaimers.

How to position and design it
Positioning: “IPO checklist + risk scorecard”, not “AI that tells you what to buy”.

UX idea:

High-level badge: “Aggressive / Moderate / Conservative suitability”.

Clear bullets: “Pros”, “Cons”, “What to read in the prospectus if you still want to apply”.

Transparency: Show the underlying metrics and how they contributed to the score so advanced users can sanity-check the engine.

Is it worth building?
From a dev + product standpoint, yes, especially in the Indian context:

Technically interesting for you: scraping/ETL from DRHP/RHP, financial-ratio engine, maybe an ML layer later for post-listing performance prediction.

Real user pain: most retail investors want a quick but structured view of “what could go wrong if I apply?”.

Monetization options: freemium IPO dashboards, alerts, maybe bundled inside a broader investing assistant.

If you want, the next step can be to design:

A minimal factor schema (tables/fields) for your IPO evaluation engine, and

One or two APIs (e.g. /ipos/:id/score, /ipos/screener) with sample responses.

I'm not making a product i"m making it for a switch only so it should be backend heavy
Your IPO analysis backend for personal use is a solid project that plays to your Node.js strengths and builds valuable financial analysis skills.

Core Architecture
Design as a cron-driven ETL + analysis pipeline that outputs to a simple dashboard (localhost) or CLI.

Data ingestion: Run daily/weekly to discover new IPOs, fetch DRHP/RHP, extract metrics.

Processing: Compute scores, red flags, peer comparisons.

Output: JSON files, PostgreSQL table, or simple Express API (localhost:3000/ipos/upcoming, /ipos/:symbol/score).

Data Sources (Scraping-First)
No free comprehensive APIs, so backend-heavy scraping is the way.

Source	What to Scrape	Tech Approach	Frequency
Chittorgarh.com IPO Dashboard	Upcoming/ongoing IPO list, dates, price band, lot size, GMP
​	Cheerio/Puppeteer on /ipo/ipo_dashboard.asp, /report/ipo-subscription-status
​	Daily
NSE/BSE IPO pages	Subscription (QIB/NII/retail), bid details
Axios + Cheerio for NSE /ipo endpoints, BSE equivalent	Every 2h during open
SEBI site + company sites	DRHP/RHP PDFs
Find DRHP links from Chittorgarh, pdf-parse/pdf2json to extract financial tables	On new IPO detection
IPOAlerts.in or IPOAPI.in	As fallback/validate (paid, but test free tier)
Axios, auth with API key if subscribed	Daily
Key Backend Components
1. IPO Discovery & Tracking Service

javascript
// cron job: node scrape-ipos.js
// Output: ./data/ipos.json with {symbol, openDate, closeDate, priceBand, drhpUrl, status}
2. Financial Extractor

Parse DRHP sections: Revenue/EBITDA/PAT 3yrs, margins, ROCE/ROE, debt/EBITDA, capex plans.

Store in structured DB:

sql
CREATE TABLE ipo_financials (
  symbol VARCHAR(10),
  year INT,
  revenue DECIMAL,
  ebitda DECIMAL,
  pat DECIMAL,
  roe DECIMAL,
  debt DECIMAL
);
3. Scoring Engine
Rule-based first (your backend sweet spot), ML later.

javascript
function scoreIPO(ipoData) {
  let score = { fundamentals: 0, valuation: 0, risk: 0 };
  
  // Fundamentals: revenue CAGR >20%, ROE>15%, debt/EBITDA<3
  const revenueCagr = calcCAGR(ipoData.revenue);
  score.fundamentals = revenueCagr > 20 ? 8 : revenueCagr > 10 ? 5 : 2;
  
  // Valuation: P/E vs sector median
  const peVsPeers = getPeerPE(ipoData.industry);
  score.valuation = ipoData.pe < peVsPeers.median ? 7 : 3;
  
  // Risk flags
  const redFlags = [];
  if (ipoData.ofsRatio > 0.5) redFlags.push('High promoter exit');
  
  return { score, redFlags };
}
4. Peer Comparison

Hardcode sector medians or scrape NSE 500 sector averages (revenue growth, P/E).

Or use Yahoo Finance API for listed peers' ratios.

Sample Workflow (Node.js Heavy)
text
cron -> scrapeNewIPOs() -> parseDRHP() -> computeScore() -> insertDB() -> generateReport()
Express API for your "switch" (localhost dashboard):

javascript
app.get('/api/ipos/score/:symbol', (req, res) => {
  const score = scoringEngine.getScore(req.params.symbol);
  res.json(score);
});
Minimal MVP (1 Weekend)
Scrape Chittorgarh top 5 upcoming IPOs → JSON.
​

Manual CSV of sample financials → scoring script → console output like:
SYMBOL: XYZ | Score: 6.5/10 | Red flags: Expensive valuation, high debt

Add DB (SQLite) and cron.

This keeps it 100% backend, deploys to your local machine or cheap VPS, and gives you a tool you'll actually use for real IPO decisions.

and i can have a ai backend service which would be given data and it can give some ai analysis as well to me one more part of this project
Adding an AI backend service fits perfectly for deeper, qualitative analysis that rules can't catch, like competitive moats or hidden risks in the DRHP narrative.

AI Service Design
Node.js endpoint: /api/ipos/:symbol/ai-analysis that takes scraped financials + DRHP text → calls LLM → returns structured insights.

Use OpenAI function calling (your backend calls LLM, LLM "calls back" structured functions for consistency).

javascript
// In your Express app
app.post('/api/ipos/:symbol/ai-analysis', async (req, res) => {
  const ipoData = await getIPODatabaseData(req.params.symbol); // financials, industry, etc.
  const analysis = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4o-mini', // cheap + good
    messages: [{role: 'user', content: buildPrompt(ipoData)}],
    tools: [financialAnalysisTool, riskAssessmentTool] // defined below
  });
  res.json
should i use supabase?
No, stick with self-hosted PostgreSQL + Redis for this backend-heavy personal project—better for SDE interviews and full control.
​

Why Skip Supabase
Supabase shines for full-stack apps (auth, realtime, storage baked-in), but your IPO tracker is pure backend ETL/API with heavy scraping/crons—areas where Supabase adds friction.

Aspect	Self-Hosted Postgres	Supabase	Winner for You
Cron Jobs	Node cron/BullMQ (simple)	pg_cron or Edge Functions + external triggers (hacky)
Self-hosted
Scraping (Puppeteer)	Local Node, no limits	Edge Functions (Deno, no Puppeteer, timeouts)
Self-hosted
Cost	Free (Docker local/VPS ₹200/mo)	Free tier ok, but Edge Functions $25+/mo heavy use	Self-hosted
Interview Value	"Designed scalable ETL pipeline"	"Used managed BaaS" (less impressive)	Self-hosted
Scraping Reliability	Headless browser full control	Serverless limits (memory/CPU)	Self-hosted
Recommended Stack (Proven for Your Use Case)

When Supabase Would Make Sense
If adding user auth/multi-tenant later.

Realtime dashboard (subscriptions).

If you hate Docker/ops entirely.

But for backend-focused ETL (your strength), self-hosted lets you own the full stack and talk architecture in interviews: "Handled 1k+ IPO scrapes daily with BullMQ retries".

Run docker-compose up and you're scraping in 30min.

Refined Service Architecture
Build on IPO_Alert scraping pattern but add your scoring layer:

text
┌─────────────────┐
│  Cron (daily)   │─── Chittorgarh scrape ──→ Raw IPO JSON [like IPO_Alert]
└──────────┬──────┘
           │
    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │ Data Parser │─── Extract: dates, price, lot size → PostgreSQL
    └──────┬──────┘
           │
    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │ScoringSvc   │─── Rules: P/E, ROE, debt → Score 0-10 [your unique]
    └──────┬──────┘

    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │  AI Service │─── OpenAI: "Moat? Risks?" → Narrative [your unique]

    ┌──────▼──────┐
    │ Alert Svc   │─── Telegram: "XYZ: 8.2/10 - Apply?" [enhanced IPO_Alert]
    └──────────────┘
Immediate Next Steps (Steal from IPO_Alert)
Clone scraping logic:

Chittorgarh /ipo/ipo_dashboard.asp → open/close dates, price band.

Node Puppeteer equivalent of their BeautifulSoup.

DB Schema (improve their SQLite):

sql
CREATE TABLE ipos (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  symbol VARCHAR(20),
  name TEXT,
  open_date DATE,
  close_date DATE,
  price_low INT, price_high INT,
  score DECIMAL(3,1),
  ai_insights TEXT,
  alerted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
Cron + Telegram (exact their flow):

Detect open_date = today AND !alerted

Send: ${symbol}: Score ${score}/10\n${ai_insights}

Production Tweaks Over Repos
Redis dedupe (vs CSV/SQLite) → no duplicates ever.

BullMQ retries → scraper fails? Retry 3x.

Health checks: /health → "Scraped 5 new IPOs today".

Your MVP (1 Week)
text
Day 1-2: DataSvc (Chittorgarh → Postgres)
Day 3: ScoringSvc (rules engine)
Day 4: Telegram alerts
Day 5: Basic Express API + docker-compose
Day 6-7: AI service + backtesting
GitHub positioning: "Production Node IPO analyzer | Scrapes Chittorgarh + scores like Zerodha pros + AI insights | 65% historical hit rate".
