## How IPO Scoring Works

IPO Analyzer uses a proprietary scoring system that evaluates IPOs across three key dimensions:

### 1. Fundamentals Score (40% Weight)

Evaluates the company's financial health based on:

| Metric | What It Measures | Scoring Criteria |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Revenue Growth** | Year-over-year revenue increase | Higher growth = Higher score |
| **ROE (Return on Equity)** | Profitability relative to shareholder equity | >15% is considered good |
| **ROCE (Return on Capital Employed)** | Efficiency of capital utilization | >15% is considered good |
| **EBITDA Margin** | Operating profitability | Higher margin = Higher score |
| **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** | Financial leverage | <1.0 is preferred, >1.5 is a red flag |

### 2. Valuation Score (35% Weight)

Assesses whether the IPO is priced fairly:

| Metric | What It Measures | Scoring Criteria |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **P/E Ratio** | Price relative to earnings | Compared against sector median |
| **P/E vs Sector Median** | Relative valuation | Lower than sector = Better score |
| **Issue Size** | Total offering amount | Contextual assessment |
| **Grey Market Premium** | Market sentiment indicator | Positive GMP = Higher score |

### 3. Governance Score (25% Weight)

Evaluates management and ownership structure:

| Metric | What It Measures | Scoring Criteria |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **OFS Ratio** | Offer for Sale percentage | High OFS (>50%) is a red flag |
| **Promoter Holding** | Post-issue promoter stake | Higher retention = Better score |
| **Fresh Issue vs OFS** | Capital usage allocation | More fresh issue = Better |

### Overall Score Calculation

```
Overall Score = (Fundamentals × 0.40) + (Valuation × 0.35) + (Governance × 0.25)
```

Each component is scored on a scale of 0-10, resulting in an overall score of 0-10.

### Risk Level Classification

| Risk Level | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| **Conservative** | Overall score >= 7.0 with minimal red flags |
| **Moderate** | Overall score 5.0-7.0 OR few red flags present |
| **Aggressive** | Overall score < 5.0 OR significant red flags |

### Red Flags Detected

The system automatically detects and flags these risk factors:

1. **High OFS Ratio** - Promoters selling >50% of shares (aggressively exiting)
2. **Expensive P/E** - P/E ratio significantly above sector median
3. **Weak Revenue Growth** - Below-average revenue growth trends
4. **High Debt Burden** - Debt-to-Equity ratio >1.5
5. **Low Promoter Holding** - Post-issue promoter stake <50%
6. **Negative GMP** - Grey market trading below issue price
7. **Below-Average ROE/ROCE** - Returns below industry benchmarks
