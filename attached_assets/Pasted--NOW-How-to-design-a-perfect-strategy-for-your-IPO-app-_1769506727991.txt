🚀 NOW: How to design a perfect strategy for your IPO app (No code, just architecture)
⭐ Your Use Case:

Market hours = 10:00 to 16:00 → 6 hours a day

You want to refresh IPO data for your users every X minutes

But you must stay under 25 requests per day

Meaning:

⚠️ You CANNOT call the API every 20 minutes.

6 hours = 360 minutes
20 minute interval = 18 calls daily → too high
(And if you fetch multiple pages, requests increase.)

🎯 The Perfect Free-Tier Strategy
1) Understand what data changes during the day

During market hours, the only IPO values that keep changing:

GMP (but you don’t have GMP in free tier)

Listing price (only on listing day)

Status changing from upcoming → open → closed

So you do NOT need to fetch everything every time.

🎯 Strategy Overview
Your Daily Request Budget = 25

So allocate like this:

✔️ A) Fetch ALL open IPOs (once per day)

This is the “heaviest” call because you need pagination.

Example typical counts:

2–5 ongoing IPOs → around 2–5 requests

Very rare to exceed 8

So:
Daily cost: ~5 requests

Do this once at around 10:15 AM.

✔️ B) Fetch ALL upcoming IPOs (once per day)

Again pagination but upcoming IPOs are also few.

Cost: ~5 requests/day

Run around mid-day (12 PM).

✔️ C) Fetch ALL listed IPOs (once per day)

Only IPOs listed in last 3 days are returned.

Usually 2–3 IPOs → 3 requests max.

Run around 2 PM.

✔️ D) Fetch specific IPO details only when needed

If user opens the IPO detail page → then make 1 request to fetch /ipos/{identifier}.

Realistically:

~5 requests/day

✔️ Total Daily Usage Estimate
Task	Requests/day
Fetch OPEN IPOs	~5
Fetch UPCOMING IPOs	~5
Fetch LISTED IPOs	~3
On-demand IPO details	~5
TOTAL	18 / 25

→ Safe. You still have 7 requests buffer.

🧊 MOST IMPORTANT RULE
❗ You should NEVER poll the server every 20 minutes for data.

Instead:

Fetch each category only once per day.

Why?
Because IPO metadata does not change minute-to-minute.

🔥 The MOST Efficient Fetch Strategy (Free Tier Optimised)
Every day — automatically:
10:15 AM

Fetch ALL open IPOs → store them locally in your DB/app cache

12:00 PM

Fetch ALL upcoming IPOs → update DB

2:00 PM

Fetch newly listed IPOs → update DB

Throughout the day:

When user clicks an IPO → fetch /ipos/{id}
(1 request → acceptable and only used when needed)

🧠 Additional Optimization (reduces requests further)
✔️ Cache IPO IDs for the whole week

Once you fetched IPO list (IDs), you DO NOT need to fetch them again.

Instead:

Store all IPO IDs locally

Fetch individual IPO’s details only for the ones whose status may change today

Status changes logic:

If today is between startDate & endDate → track it

If today is listingDate → track it

This reduces requests dramatically.

You may even go down to:
12–15 daily requests only

🎯 The Bottom Line

If you follow this flow:

You will NEVER cross the free plan limit of 25/day.

And your app will still feel:
