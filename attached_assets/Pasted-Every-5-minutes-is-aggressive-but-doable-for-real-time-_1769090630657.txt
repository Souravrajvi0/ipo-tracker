Every 5 minutes is aggressive but doable for real-time IPO tracking. Here's what you can and cannot reliably get every 5 minutes for free:

What Updates Every 5 Minutes (Realistic)
Data	Source	Real-Time	Notes
Live Subscription %	Chittorgarh
​	✅ Updates ~30min	Official updates every 30min-1h, not 5min
GMP (Grey Market)	Chittorgarh GMP tracker
​	✅ Updates hourly	Market-driven, real-time but not guaranteed 5min
Bid Activity	NSE/BSE bid page
✅ During bidding hours	Updates intraday but refreshes ~15-30min
Post-listing CMP	NSE live prices
​	✅ Every 1-2 seconds	Real stock exchanges (use NSE-API)
​
Reality Check: Every 5 Minutes
NSE/BSE official data (subscription): Updates every 30 minutes to 1 hour, not 5 minutes. This is NSE/BSE policy, not a technical limitation.

Why? NSE publishes: Open (9:15 AM), Mid (12:30 PM), Close (5:30 PM), and maybe 1-2 intraday updates. That's it.

Here's What You CAN Do Every 5 Minutes
Option 1: Poll Multiple Sources (Best Approach)
text
Every 5 minutes:
├─ Chittorgarh subscription page (might be same data, but worth checking)
├─ NSE bid details page (refresh, get latest)
├─ Groww IPO page (backup)
├─ InvestorGain live report (another source)
└─ Calculate delta (did % change? Flag it)
Service: Multi-source poller. If ANY source shows new data, log it with timestamp.

Option 2: Focus on What Matters
During IPO bidding hours (9:15 AM - 5:30 PM IST):

Poll Chittorgarh subscription every 15-30 minutes ✅

Poll NSE bid details every 15 minutes ✅

Track GMP changes every 30 minutes ✅

Alert when subscription crosses thresholds (e.g., >10x, >20x) ✅

After bidding closes (5:30 PM):

Check allotment next day (T+3)

Track post-listing prices (CMP updates real-time)

Real-Time Services You CAN Build (Every 5 Min)
Service 1: Multi-Source Subscription Poller ⭐
text
Every 5 minutes during bidding:
├─ Scrape Chittorgarh sub page
├─ Scrape NSE bid details
├─ Scrape Groww IPO page
└─ Compare with previous snapshot
    ├─ If subscription % changed → Log + Alert
    └─ Store delta (old → new)
Output: {symbol, time, old_sub_pct, new_sub_pct, delta, source}

Why: Detect momentum shifts early. E.g., "QIB subscription jumped from 2.5x to 5x in 10 min → high demand."

Service 2: GMP Tracker ⭐
text
Every 5 minutes:
├─ Fetch GMP from Chittorgarh
├─ Fetch GMP from InvestorGain
├─ Compare + flag if divergence
└─ Track trend (is GMP rising/falling?)
Output: {symbol, gmp, trend, source, timestamp}

Why: GMP often changes intraday based on grey market sentiment. Early signal.

Service 3: Alert Trigger Engine ⭐
text
Every 5 minutes:
├─ Check subscription against thresholds
│   ├─ If subscription > 10x → Alert "HIGH DEMAND"
│   ├─ If subscription > 20x → Alert "EXTREME DEMAND"
│   └─ If GMP jumped 10% → Alert "GMP SPIKE"
├─ Check if new IPOs opened (daily check)
└─ Push to Telegram/Discord immediately
Output: Real-time alerts to your phone.

Service 4: Live Price Tracker (Post-Listing) ⭐⭐⭐
text
Every 5 minutes (after listing):
├─ Fetch CMP from NSE-API for listed IPOs
├─ Calculate P&L vs purchase price
├─ Compare vs Nifty50 (over/underperforming?)
└─ Alert if P&L hits targets (+20%, -10%, etc.)
Output: {symbol, cmp, listing_price, p_l_pct, vs_nifty, timestamp}

Why: This is where real money is made/lost. Track in real-time.

Cron: Every 5 minutes (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, ...)
│
├─ If IPO is OPEN (bidding):
│   ├─ Poll Chittorgarh subscription
│   ├─ Poll NSE bid details
│   ├─ Compare with previous snapshot
│   ├─ Detect changes (delta)
│   └─ Alert if threshold crossed
│
└─ If IPO is LISTED (post-bidding):
    ├─ Poll NSE-API for CMP
    ├─ Calculate P&L vs purchase price
    └─ Alert if stop-loss/target hit
Realistic Expectations
During IPO Bidding (9:15 AM - 5:30 PM IST):

✅ Polling every 5 min makes sense (capture momentum)

✅ 80% of polls = same data (no change)

✅ 20% of polls = new data (subscription/GMP updated)

✅ Alerts only on deltas (no spam)

Outside Bidding Hours:

❌ Polling every 5 min = waste (data frozen)

✅ Switch to daily/hourly checks

✅ Re-enable every 5 min on next IPO open

After Listing:

✅ Poll NSE-API every 5 min = real-time price tracking

✅ Stock prices update every 1-2 seconds anyway

Summary
Every 5 minutes is achievable, but:

✅ Subscription data updates every 30 min - 1 hour (not 5 min)

✅ GMP updates hourly

✅ Post-listing prices update every 1-2 seconds (real-time)

✅ Polling every 5 min captures changes faster even if source updates less frequently

Best strategy: Poll every 5 min, log only deltas (changes), alert only on threshold crossings. This gives you real-time awareness without data overload
